   <p align="left">Gravy Falls is an American animated television series created by Alex Hirsch, and produced by Disney Television Animation for Disney Channel and Disney XD. The first episode aired as a sneak preview on June 15, 2012 and the series officially started on June 29, 2012. On March 12, 2013, the show was renewed for a second season at the annual Disney upfront. The series was moved to Disney XD in the spring of 2014, along with Wander Over Yonder and premiered new episodes there.[2] Despite this, "Scary-oke" and "Little Gift Shop of Horrors" premiered originally on Disney Channel.
During an AMA in August 2013, Alex Hirsch stated that while he originally expected the show to be three seasons long (one season for every month of the summer), that may be too many and instead said there likely would only be 2 seasons and a movie.[3][4] However, mid season 1, the crew had already determined how long the show would be and on November 20, 2015, Alex officially announced that the second season was the final season of the series and that there were no plans to create a following season.[5] In total, Gravity Falls consisted of 40 episodes (41 when the finale is split into two parts), 17 shorts and one special behind the scenes episode.[5]</p>
